* Introduction
  This is a better way to browse the manga that you are
  following on Batoto.
  
* Prerequisites
  Make sure that you have nodejs installed.

* Usage
  Clone the repository and within it create a file called
  =cred.js=. This file will house your Batoto credentials.

  Populate =cred.js= with the following:

  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  module.exports = {
      username: "yourusername",
      password: "yourpassword"
  }
  #+END_SRC

  After that you can you can run the scraper to scrape the 
  manga you follow from Batoto.

  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  node scraper_and_cover.js
  #+END_SRC

  this will populate your views directory with an html file containing
  a manga-cover oriented view of your followed manga.

  You can view the file by running the express server:

  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  node server.js
  #+END_SRC
